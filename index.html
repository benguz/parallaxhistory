            <p class="text">In 1976 I spent some time in a South African jail. This was after the Soweto riots… I mean, I wasn’t charged or convicted with anything. I was just put in cold storage like the Russians do.</p>

        <p class="text">I was 22 years old. I was a kid, you know, so. and I was politically active. You know I was part of the leadership of the University, and so on.</p>

        <p class="text">I spent four days in jail. I was alone in the cell, so that was fine. But it's very disturbing to be in a place where you can't tell the difference between night and day at all, you know, for 4 days it's very disorienting.</p>

    <div id="bucket">
        <br></br><p class="text">There were 70 of us in this one cell block. not not no mixture with ordinary criminals, because they didn't want us to politicize ordinary criminals.</p>
    </div>

        <br></br><p class="text">This will not be a nice experience at all. but an important one, because I know what it's like to live in a country where the rule of law doesn't exist.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">You have a system in place, if you can imagine, where a white minority controls the upper offices of State, right? So government, police, military, and so on.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">You have 80% of the population not part of that system. And there's no room. This is a zero sum game, right? If the white say, okay, we're gonna open up the system. They are out of power.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">This was not a fight that was resolved in the sense that black people then became victorious, and there was victor's justice.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">What happened in South Africa was a negotiation. It was a stalemate, a political stalemate. The whites couldn't keep power anymore. They were losing global credibility.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">I was never harmed physically. This was a fight. We knew this was a fight, you know? This is not a party.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">The head of a very very big company is run by a South African… Richemont. And they bought that company on the basis of selling cigarettes in my hometown.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">There was recently a puff piece in the FT that the owners fought against Apartheid. Now that is a lie.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">The party Government introduced the Group Areas act, which is active residential segregation. They forcibly removed the black people living there, and my parents were removed like that.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">This company didn’t say a word about it! They have a lot of explaining to do, and they haven’t done it yet.</p>
        <br></br><p class="text">So that makes me cross, actually.</p>
